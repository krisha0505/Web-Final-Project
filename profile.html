      <p class="mission-text"><strong>My background:</strong> My name is Krisha Mae Coniega, a 20 years old student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Office Administration at Clark College of Science and Technology. I am passionate about developing skills in office management, communication, and technology to prepare for a successful career in a professional business environment. As a dedicated and goal oriented individual, I strive to learn continuously and grow both personally and academically.
</p>
      <p class="vision-text"><strong>Experience with Web Design:</strong> As a student, creating a webpage was an exciting and valuable learning experience. It helped me understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how these elements work together to build functional and visually appealing websites. I learned how to structure content, add styling, and make the page interactive. This project not only improved my technical skills but also enhanced my creativity and problem-solving abilities.</p>
